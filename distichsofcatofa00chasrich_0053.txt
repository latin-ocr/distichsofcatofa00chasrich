CHASE—THE DISTICHS OF CATO

31. who silent is and melancholy‚ shun;
Perchance the quiet rivers too deep run.

32. When fortune's favor seems not thine, take thought
Of him to whom Dame F ortune less hath brought.

33. Begin what thou to finish canst not fai1;
Safer near shore than on the deep to sail.

34. Break not against the righteous man the laWS,
For God's th' avenger of the righteous cause.

35. When wealth takes wings thou shouldst not then repine;
Rejoice the more that anything is thine.

36. Sad is the fate to lose one’s hard-won gainS,
But much is saved if only health remainS.

37. Count not on life: howe’er thy way may wend,
Death shadowlike will everywhere attend.

38. The calf’s the plow's; incense doth heaven please;
Think not the god by slaughter to appease.

39. If thou art beaten, cease then to resist;
who could o'ercome will able be t’ assist.

40. When thou hast sinned‚ at once thyself chastise;
To cure the hurt thy grief will well suffice.

41. To thy old friend never unfriendly prove;
Though he be changed, forget not former love.
