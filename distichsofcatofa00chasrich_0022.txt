there is abundant evidence in the numerous Latin manuscripts
of it now in Spanish librarieS, in the many 'allusions to it in
early Spanish literature before 1500, in the many Spanish
translations of it from the thirteenth century through the
sixteenth and in the seventeenth century reference to it in the
prologue of Don Quzjjotest⁸ All over Europe there exist today
very many manuscripts in the Latin and translations of it into
the dialects and vernaculars of feudal F rance, of Holland‚ the
Engadine, Italy, Bohemia‚ Poland‚ Hungary‚ Roumania‚ Den-
mark, Sweden, Iceland, Ireland and WaleS.⁴⁹ There are Greek
versions and both Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman.⁵⁰ The ear.—
liest Anglo-Saxon seems to have been that of Aethelwold in the
tenth century.⁵1 Caxton *brought out four English editionS, the
earliest in 1477, and his successor Wynkyn de Worde one or
two more. ⁵² Yet though the next three centuries produced
many more, it is now practically impossible to purchase an
English translation of the Distichs. In 1735 Benjamin Franklin
published one in Philadelphia‚ but this has come to be so rare
that 1n 1911 a copy of it sold at auction for 31300.

An important aspect of the service rendered by these little
verses is their influence on the proverbial sayings of all European
people, for these have been greatly enriched from the Catonian
source. The numerous poetry of parental instruction and
ethical guidance from Columban's time on down through that
of Alfred the Great and much later are largely outgrowths of
the Distichs. This influence can be discerned in such as these,
