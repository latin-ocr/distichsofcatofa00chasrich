It was these last centuries of the Roman Empire which
⁷ supplied curriculum, textbookS, and to some extent method to
the schools of the middle ages, The Roman grammar school,
ludus literariuS, was the most important institutional heritage
which the medieval world received in the realm of education.
With the bre'akdown of imperial government and the confusion
and disorder incident to the passing of the power over the
western European world into the hands of the invading Ger-
man—ss'the Christian church stood forth as the chief civilizing
ag—eii‘cy oi the tisrieS, and it was the school maintained by'the
bishop in connection with the cathedral church, and to a less
extent the school of the monastery, that carried on the work of
the Roman grammar school. Latin remained the language of
the sch0015‚ and the object of all medieval grammar-school
Latin-teaching was not, as nowadays when Latin is taught,
merely to read and write Latin, but to speak it, to use it as a
living language.

In the elementary or song school of the cathedral the young
boy was taught and trained so as to be able to sing in the
cathedral choir and in the course of this preparation he acquired
some proficiency in reading and writing Latin, with a little
knowledge of its grammar, the psalter being commonly the
first book mastered. Equipped with this power, he passed on
up''*t⁷o the grammar school where now his studies were to be
those of the trivium, comprising grammar, rhetoric and dialec-
ticslor logie, and the quadrivium, consisting of arithmetic,
geometry, music and astronomy. For the earlier stages of
this curriculum the textbooks used were a grammar and a first
reader, and until long after our modern times had been ushered
in by the Renaissance and the Reformation, Cato's M oral Dis-
tichs was this first Latin reader. Throughout the early centuries
of the Middle Ages schoolbooks were scarce and possession of

[· them was restricted to the masterS. By them the subject
ἱ matter was dictated to their pupils who were required to commit
