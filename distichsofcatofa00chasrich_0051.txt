CHASE—rnn msrrcns or CATO 39

What's said to thee with cau tion ponder well;
Men’s practice words may hide as well as tell.

Praetice with zeal the skill thou’st learned. Thou'lt find,
Use trains the hand as study does the mind.

Let not death’s sure approach thee terrify;
Who life despises doth not fear to die.

Learn only of the learned: teach th' untaught;
Knowledge of truth must to all men be brought.

If thou wouldst sanely live, take this to beart,—
Avoid excesses; thence diseases start.

Condemn not thou with inconsistency
What once thou hast approved full publicly.

When fortune smileS, forget not she may frown3
When fortune frownS, be not too much cast down.

Cease not to learn3 wisdom's through study gained;
By lapse of years alone ’t is ne'er attained.

Praise not o'ermuch: one day’s enough to show

If he, oft claimed thy friend, is really so.

To wish ior knowledge is no cause ior shame;
To have it merits praise; to -scorn it, blame.

30. With love and wine pleasure and striie are knit;

Cleave to the good in these; the bad omit.
