CHASE—THE DISTICHS OF CATO

Seek quick the truth when once thou dost suspect,
Dangers grow large when nourished by neglect.

When hurtful lust hath hold of thee, refrain
From giving to thy appetites free rein.

Thy sear of beasts declares their rule o’er thee;
Know thou that man alone should dreaded be.

Not strength alone, but wisdom, t00, possess;
Thus thou canst gain a name for manlineSS.

When sick, from friends seek thou relief. Be sure
Thy trusted friend can give thee certain cure.

Why for thy guilt should guiltless victims bleed?

’T is vain to think their blood doth cleanse thy deed.

Whene'er a trusty friend thou dost desire,
Not of his wealth but of his life enquire.

Employ thy gains; the name of miser flee;
What good is wealth when want still lives with thee?

If through thy life thou wouldst a good name save,
Be not to pleasure base an abject slave.

F lout not old age while thou dost sense possess;
Age ever brings to all some childishneSS.

Learn thou a trade lest wealth may fly away;
For skill, once gained, shall ever with thee stay.
