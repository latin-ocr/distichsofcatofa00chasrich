CHASE—THE DISTICHS OF CATO ll

Vaters Lehren.⁵³ F ranklin's Poor Richard's Almanac, t00, gives
internal evidence of having received influence from that source.

This conquering career of the Distichs os Cato was not due to
superlative greatness of theme or content but primarily to
their simplicity and the homeliness and practicalness of their
wisdom. ’ Though the period 'of’ their origin is close to that in
which Christianity was accepted by the Roman state, their
author is judged to have been an adherent of the old Roman
gods. But while there is nothing certainly suggestive of
Christianity in these verseS‚ their pagan flavor was so slight
as to constitute no disqualification, nor do they reveal any

’ special philosophie traces. What the author seeks most to

inculcate is prudence‚ caution, self- -possession, shrewd adapta·
tion to circumstanceS‚ c‚ourage moderation and self- control.

The distichs that have come down to us are undoubtedly no
more than the mutilated fragments of the original collection.
The more diligently it was used in the Middle Ages the more
distortion‚ confusion and mutilation occurred and changed its
original shape. Of the many Latin versions now accessible the
best is that of Aemilius Baehrens in Volume ΙΙΙ of Poetae Latini
Minores (Leipsic‚ 1881) and that is the basis of this translation.
Where it h‘as been practicable‚ use has been made of two English
translations very long out of print. One is that of James Wright
printed in London in 16633 the other that already referred to, ,
“printed and sold by B. Franklin‚ 1735,” the translator’s
name not being given.

The distichs here presented in translation comprise the
common or usual collection made up of four bookS‚ of forty,
thirty-one, twenty—four and forty-nine two line verseS. Books
ΙΙ, III and IV have each a special preface in verse ; this seems
to have been lost as to I. The collection as a whole is preceded
by a group of fifty-six very short proverbs in prose, most of them
of but two words each in the Latin, and before these is a brief
introduction‚ also in prose. It seems very certain that both
this introduction and the prose proverbs are of different and
later authorship than the distichs themselves.⁵⁴
