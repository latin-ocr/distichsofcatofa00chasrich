INTRODUCTION

“He knew no Catoun, for his wit was rude,'' said Geoffrey
Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales about one of his characterS, the
carpenter.¹ This was in about 1400, probably more than eleven
hundred years after Cat0, or Catoun as the Norman-French
called him, had brought together his collection of moral couplets
for the instruction of the young. So nearly universal was their

j·- vogue at this time that Chaucer could be sure that all would
Ϊ understand that the ignorant carpenter had not gone in his
ᾗ schooling even so far as the first reader. Almost four hundred
ζ’ years after Chaucer this collection continued to be of great
educational importance on two and perhaps three continentS,
. and se, having had more than fifteen centuries of continuous
'¹ service in education, is thoroughly deserving of consideration.
’ who this Cato was and when and where he lived have been
ᾖ the subject of conjecture and enquiry for very many centuries,
Distichs of this collection were already known around 200 Αζι).,
the first trace of them being in two epitaphs which contained
a couplet or two. Commodian, a poet of the third century,
used them and imitated their style.² The earliest appearance
of the collection under the name Cato was in a letter of Vindi-
cianuS‚ proconsul in Africa to the Emperor Valentinian who
died in 375 A.D.³ By one group of investigators it has been
urged that because Vindicianus declared that he found the
book widely circulated in Africa and because it resembles
in language peculiarities and in versification the other poetic
works of Roman Africa these distichs were the work of an
African rhetorician.⁴ Others have preferred to trust the
