testimony of a tenth century manuscript of Paris which de-
clares that the author was of Cordova.⁵ These are but two
of many strongly urged theories of origin. John of Salisbury,
the most learned man in literary matters in the twelfth century,
wrote in his PolycraticuS, “Thus says Cato or someone else, for
the author is unknown.'’⁶ Despite much search by many stu-
dents since the time of that learned Englishman his conclusion
remains the answer of scholarship. Neither of the names Cato
or DionysiuS, which came to be associated with it in the title,
belonged to the author of our collection, though some of the
distichs that comprise it may be ascribable to Cato the Censor.⁷
It is not that, however, that gave the collection its name, but
the fact that the old Cato was associated with wisdom and
wisdom literature in the form of practical rules of life which he
had written for his son, and of a poem on mannerS.⁸ So in an
uncritical age his name came to be attached to this collection
of widely accepted aphorismS, some of which had a Roman
origin and some a Greek.⁹ Good authority supports the
opinion that between 117 and 324 this collection of apothegms
was made by an unknown writer living in the western part of
the Roman Empire, and that by the close of the fifth century
the name os Cato had come to be attached to it.1⁰ The prefix
Dionysius was not added until the fifteenth century, when the
learned Scaliger mistakenly used it in one or both of the editions
he published.u The collection in these many centuries of service
has borne a great variety of names such as Dicta Catoni5‚ Dicta
