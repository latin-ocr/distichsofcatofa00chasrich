printed, entitled the School of Slovenrie or Cato turn'd wrong
side outwarde.

Its use in the great English public schools was prescribed by
various statutes of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries so
that it did service in Eton‚ Westminster, Durham‚ Sandwich,
St. Βο05, Bangor and Harrow. ²⁶ Cardinal Wolsey directed that
it be used in Ipswich School which he founded 111 1528.27 Mul-
caster, 1531-1611, for twenty-five years head master of the
famous Merchant Taylor's School and later master of St. Paul'S,
objected to the distichs on the ground that the ethical teaching
they contained was too old for boys ²⁸ But 111 this judgment as
well as in many others he was ahead οἱ 1115 age educationally,
and 111 the two generations that succeeded his the leading school
masterS, Brinsley and Hoole, both used it in their schools and
brought out editions 01 it. ²⁹ Both of these masters wrote
influential books on the art of teaching and the profession of
school- keeping. ³⁰ These quaint manuals give respectful men-
tion of Cato' s Distichs and show interestingly how this Latin
text was employed in their classrooms inthe times of John
Milton and Oliver Cromwell. Construing line by line, parsing
each word in elaborate, formal fashion and answering in Latin
questions about it in the same language‚ were, some features
of the prevailing method. There was also much writing of
themes upon the problems of behavior of which the distichs
treat.

That the popularity which this textbook enjoyed in the
seventeenth century endured in England even to the end of the
eighteenth is shown by the title page of an edition now owned
by the Library of Columbia University. This reveals so in-
terestingly that century's educational emphasis and practice,
