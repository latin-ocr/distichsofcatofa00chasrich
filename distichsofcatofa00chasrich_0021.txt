ansn--THE msncns or CATo 9

In the later part of the ninth century Christian of Stablo in
Aquitaine and Gerald of St. Gall reveal their literary obligation
to Cato, as does Auxilius of N aples in the next century.⁴⁰
Alfred the Great of England drew upon them for his “Proverbs.'’⁴¹
Twelfth century writers freely quote them,—John of Salisbury
in his Polycraticus and Walter Map in his De N ugis Curialium.
The fourteenth century Piers Plowman contains many of these
apothegms with expression of acknowledgment of their source&
Bits of wisdom from “Catoun which that was so wys a man''
are embodied in several of Chaucer's taleS.⁴³ Marlowe in his
Jew os Malta makes Barabas soliloquize in terms of one of
Cato’s sayingS. Illustrations of these sorts could be multiplied
to heap high the testimony to the service of this medieval Cato
to English literature. The earliest translation of Cato into
the German of which we have knowledge is that of Notker
ΙΙΙ into the Old High German of the eleventh century. ⁴⁴ This
has not coine down to uS. But preserved for us in many extant
manuscripts of varying text is a Middle High German transla-
tion of unknown authorship, dating probably from the thir·
teenth century.⁴⁵ From that time on translations abounded
throughout Germany, and nowhere was Cato more widely and
adoringly read than there. The earliest evidence of its influence
on German literature is that apparent in the poems of Freidank

 

· in the thirteenth century.⁴⁶ For many centuries thereafter,

various German writers use and quote Cato, This is conspicu-
ously true of Opitz in the seventeenth century.⁴⁷ Of similar
popularity and influence in both medieval and modern Spain
