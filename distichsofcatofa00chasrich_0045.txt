CHASE—THE DISTICHS OF CATO

From others’ actions seek to find the clue
To what thou best mayst shun and best mayst do.

Begin what thou canst end, without avail
Is that begun which speedily doth fail.

Speak out when wrong thou knowest hath been done,

Lest thou thro' silence urge the culprit on.

When sued unjulstly to the judge apply;
The Law’s intent is wrong to rectify.

To what thou dost deserve with calm submit3
If thou hast guilt, chastise thyself for it.

Read much and much of it forget: 'T is well
T’ admire but not believe what poets tell.

T alk little at thy feasts lest men esteem
Thee wordy, though thou fain wouldst witty seem.

Thy wroth wife's speech sear not. But have a care;
A woman by her weeping can ensnare.

Use without waste whatever gains thou'st made;
who wastes his own, will others’ rights invade.

Judge not that death’s a thing to apprehend3
If ’t is not good, yet ’t is of bad the end.

Bear thy wife’s tongue when she hath useful been3
Impatience and retort alike are sin.
