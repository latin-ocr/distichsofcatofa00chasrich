CHASE—THE DISTICHS OF CATO 35

24. For both dear parents equal love e’er hold; ’
Be not to father fond: to mother cold.

BOOK IV

Γ [If thou wishest to lead a life free from careS, cling not to

ξ faults which injure character. Remember that these precepts

’ must be read often by thee. Thou wilt find in them a teacher
through whom thou wilt be able to transform thyself.]

1. Wouldst happy be, scorn wealth. Those always seem
To beg it greedily who wealth esteem.

2. Nature her favors never will deny
If what thy needs require will satisfy.

3. When to poor judgment thou dost failure owe,
Say not that Fortune's blind, for 't is not so,

4. Love nard, but use it sparingly; refrain
From persumes which all decent men disdain.

5. when rich, well for¹ thy body care. One’s wealth
Is of but small avail if he lack health.

ζ . 6. Since thou at school thy teacher's blows hast known,
Thou'lt better bear thy father's angry tone.

7. What certain profit bringS, let that be done;
Uncertain risks and unsafe projects shun.

8. Give as thou canst to those who ask, for know ·
Thou didst well gain when thou didst well bestow.
