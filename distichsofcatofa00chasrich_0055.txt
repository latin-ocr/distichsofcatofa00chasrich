CHASEâ€”THE DISTICHS OF CATO

To show thy gratitude take ev'ry care,
Lest on thee fall the shame that ingrates bear.

A life of naught but dread can not be sweet:
For those by terror held, death is most meet.

When servants thou hast bought, remember then,

Altho' thou term'st them slaveS, they still are men.

Secure thy chance when first it be at hand,
Lest that once scorned thou dost in vain demand.

In bad men's sudden death take not delight,
Those only die well who have lived aright.

Having a wife, be watchful of thy friend,
Lest false to thee, thy fame and goods he spend.

When thou at last from study hast much lore,
Recall there's much to learn from life's vast stote.

Dost ask why I this form of verses choose?
Know brevity did bid me couplets use.
