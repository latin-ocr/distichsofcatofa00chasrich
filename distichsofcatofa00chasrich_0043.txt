CHASE—THE DISTICHS OF CATO

Upright, care not if bad men thee deride;

’T is not within our power men's tongues to guide.

When as a witness thou must needs appear,
F avor thy friend, but keep thy good name clear.

Deem soft cajoling speech an empty cheat;
Truth naked iS, but flatt'ry cloaks deceit.

. Inaction's sure to waste one’s life away;

Sloth in the mind doth on the body prey.

With pleasure lighten now and then thy care,
That so life's burdens thou mayst better bear.

. Blame not what other men may say or do,

Lest thee they jeer and for the same thing, too.

. Thy heritage preserve and multiply‚

Lest thou the world’s harsh censure justify.

If wealth aboundS, when life draws near its end,
Be not a stingy, but a generous friend. q

Thy slave’s wise counsel, do not proudly scorn
But prize good sense e’en in the lowly born.

If from thy wealth and place thou dost descend,
Still be content with what the seasons send.

For dnwry take not to thyself a wife,
Nor keep her with thee if she spoils thy life.
